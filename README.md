# CLI-To-Do-List-Application-Python
About the Code

This Python script is a simple CLI To-Do List application that lets users add, view, and remove tasks.
It uses lists to store tasks in memory and file handling to save them permanently in tasks.txt, so your tasks remain available even after restarting the program.
